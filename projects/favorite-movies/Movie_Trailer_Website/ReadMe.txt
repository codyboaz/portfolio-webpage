Read Me

This program is used to display my favorite movies on an HTML document. The web page shows the title of the movie and the movies poster image. When one of the poster images is clicked on the movies trailer will be played. Take some time and click through all of the different movie trailers to see what kind of movies I enjoy!

To create the HTML document:

While in the project folder open the entertainment_center.py file.
Run this file and the HTML file will be generated and open in your default web browser.
